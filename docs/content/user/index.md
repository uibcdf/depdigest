# User

Welcome. This guide is organized as a tutorial path so you can integrate
DepDigest in your library without friction.

If you follow the pages in order, you will go from a minimal setup to advanced
patterns and edge cases.

## Learning Path

1. `Quick Start`: first working integration in minutes.
2. `Mini Library Walkthrough`: complete narrative from zero to production.
3. `Configuration`: how `_depdigest.py` defines your dependency policy.
4. `Hard vs Soft`: what each dependency type means in practice.
5. `Integrating in Your Library`: implementation blueprint for real codebases.
6. `Conditional Dependencies`: enforce dependencies only when needed.
7. `Lazy Registry`: lazy plugin/module loading at scale.
8. `Introspection`: expose dependency status to your users.
9. `Edge Cases`: recovecos you should know before production.
10. `Troubleshooting`: fast diagnosis for common integration failures.
11. `Production Checklist`: final verification before release.
12. `FAQ`: short answers to common integration questions.
