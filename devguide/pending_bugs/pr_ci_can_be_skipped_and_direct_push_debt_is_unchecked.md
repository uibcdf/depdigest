# PR CI can be skipped and direct-push debt is unchecked

**Detector correction on 2026-09-29:** the review in
`uibcdf/pyunitwizard#91` reproduced an old workflow-run listing from GitHub's
`branch=main` API filter, and the same behavior was observed in SMonitor.
This detector now lists runs without that API filter and checks
`head_branch=main` locally, together with commit ancestry and executed
Linux test steps. A focused regression rejects an otherwise green run from
a feature branch.

At `166e9c9`, routine CI `36640883666` and policy `36640884216`
passed. The [corrected probe](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36640913043)
recognized `80e021e` as the executed full-matrix watermark and found zero
pending skipped commits. The matrix jobs were omitted. Actual daily schedule,
hosted PR execution and platform claims still need review.

## What

At `0353087`, the primary `CI.yaml` PR test ignored documentation paths and
allowed `[skip ci]` in PR titles or `skip-ci` in branch names to skip its test
job. `main` had no effective branch rules. Direct-push skip markers had no
daily full-suite recovery. The
[weekly twelve-cell matrix](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36455844421)
passed at that exact commit, including executed `Run tests` steps in all four
Linux cells. This is a routing and enforcement gap, not a failed test suite.

## How

Run the complete Linux 3.13 PR test without workflow path or title/branch
skip conditions. Require its stable check on PRs, while administrators retain
direct pushes. Preserve the existing weekly and manual full matrix. Add a
conditional daily full matrix at 00:47 America/Mexico_City that detects
skipped commits since the last executed, green Linux matrix. If run history
or API evidence is unavailable, run it. A probe input checks the backlog
without dispatching test jobs.

## Why

DepDigest is a shared support library. A green weekly matrix does not guard
a PR whose test job never ran, and repeated skipped direct pushes can leave
regressions unseen. The conditional daily route implements the suite policy
in `uibcdf/molsyssuite#39` without requiring a full matrix after each commit.

## Acceptance criteria

- The required PR test cannot be omitted by local filters or skip conditions.
- Skipped direct pushes stay due until an executed full Linux matrix passes.
- Hosted routine, full-matrix and probe evidence are recorded.
- Branch protection preserves direct pushes for the named internal maintainers.
- The first real nightly and PR route are observed before calling this adopted.

## Resolution

Commit `e6dfa7c` implements the workflow and detector. At that exact commit,
[routine CI](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36533588363)
and [MolSysSuite policy](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36533589077)
passed. The [probe-only dispatch](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36534534264)
recognized the executed weekly matrix `36455844421` at `0353087` as its
watermark, found zero later skipped commits, and omitted all matrix jobs.

The `main` branch now requires the strict `Test on ubuntu-latest, Python 3.13`
check. Administrators are exempt from the PR gate; the only current
collaborators with push permission are `dprada` and `LMMV`, both
administrators. Keep this issue open until the first actual nightly, hosted
PR route, and platform-claim review.

The direct push of `d779cfa` with `[skip ci]` exercised that bypass. A
[second probe-only dispatch](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36534652166)
found exactly that skipped commit after the `0353087` full-matrix watermark
and reported that full recovery is due. It omitted all matrix jobs because
the dispatch was diagnostic. A
[manual full-matrix dispatch](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36534834729)
then passed all twelve jobs at `80e021e`, including the four Linux `Run tests`
steps. The [post-matrix probe](https://github.com/uibcdf/depdigest/actions/runs/36534985790)
recognized `80e021e` as the new executed watermark and found zero pending
skipped commits; its matrix jobs were omitted. The actual daily schedule and
hosted PR execution remain to be observed. Keep the issue open until those
outcomes and the platform-claim review are recorded centrally.
